# CSC417-PBA-Lab

In the class of CSC417, I have implemented few projects on various topics in Physics Based Animation. Here are the summary of each lab:

## [Lab 1](https://github.com/Winnerrang/1D-Mass-Spring):
In this lab, I implemented a simple 1-D mass-spring system using the Euler-Lagrange Method to derive the equation of motion. For time integration, I implemented various methods, including the forward and backward Euler methods, the 4th order Runge-Kutta algorithm, and the Sympletic Euler Method.

Here is the 1-D system using backward Euler that will create a artificial damping affect.

## [Lab 2](https://github.com/Winnerrang/CSC417-3D-mass-spring/tree/cf402c040133689f67da7b601c8c097dee15f07c):
In Lab 2, I utilized a 3-D mass-spring system to simulate deformable meshes. To formulate the equation of motion, I determined the potential energy, kinetic energy, and their derivative respect generalized coordinate and velocity of the system. For the time integration, I employed the linear implicit Euler method by constructing the stiffness gradient of the system.
